--------------------------
    December 2009:
        - change field length of table aa.invocation_mappings.path from 100 to 255.
        - Change sm table structure + sm-schemas (use objid or href, dependent on request).
    January 2010:
        -Upgrade to Lucene 3.0. Changes:
            -score is not calculated when searching with wildcard or range-query (<,>,<=,>=)
             due to performance-reasons. Anyway, it is configurable if scores are required.
            -Use quotes when searching for words starting with a digit.

        -Configuration for Search + Indexing externalized. Please see docu of Search + Browse Component.
        -Logging changed. 
        -Copy all files located in jboss-patch.zip into your jboss
        -Role-Schema changed to 0.5. Attribute relation-attribute-object-type added to element scope-def.
         This is done to be able to decide if a grant that is created 
         for a role has scope on object-type that is allowed by the role.
        -Methods UserAccount.- and UserGroup.createGrant throw InvalidScopeException 
         if provided scope-object-type is not allowed for role.
        -Include CQL 2.0 sorting into search

    May 2010:
        -Add method retrieveParents to ItemHandler + ContainerHandler
        -Add virtual resource parents to item and container.
        --> change version of item and item-list to 0.10
        --> change version of container and container-list to 0.9
        --> change version of member-list to 0.10
        --> change version of srw-types to 0.4

changes since version 1.1
--------------------------
    October 2009:
    	- Added Content Model. First incomplete implementation supporting list of metadata records,
    	  simple behavior, and setting of DC-transformation XSLT.
    	- The content of the element 'resources' in the XML representation of eSciDoc Resources is
    	  no longer inline. The complete 'resources' section is retrievable separately as before.

    September 2009:
        - XSD search-result to 0.8 (element score added)
	    - XSD User group to 0.6 (renamed user group selector type from "external" into "user-attribute")
        - Modification of logic how to retrieve xml for search-result from Lucene:
          Dont write the surrounding search-result-record-element into lucene
          but just the xml you want to retrieve with the search-result.
          SRW adds surrounding search-result-record-element, containing the xml you wrote
          into the lucene-index plus highlighting-information and score.
          So please change your local stylesheets accordingly.
          (see https://www.escidoc.org/jira/browse/INFR-675)
        - Reindexing is required to change from former framework-version to 1.2
        - added configuration what to do if error occurs while extracting text from pdf while indexing.
          If you want to index the objects even if error occurs while extracting text from pdf,
          make sure you have gsearch.ignoreTextExtractionErrors = true in your escidoc-core.properties.
        - XSD User Account to 0.7 (organizational-units element and email element removed)
        - Database Table aa.user_account_ous removed. OUs of user now is stored as user-attribute
        - Added property escidoc-core.aa.attribute-name.ou that defines the user-attribute-name 
          holding the escidoc-organizational unit. This is used to resolve the hierarchy of org-units the user belongs to.
          default is 'o'. Can get overwritten in escidoc-core.properties. 
          Value of the user-attribute has to be the unique escidoc-id and not the name of the organizational-unit!
        - Added property escidoc-core.aa.attribute-name.common-name that holds the name 
          of the Shibboleth-Attribute containing the common-name of the user. 
          This is important for creation of the userProxy if logging in via Shibboleth.
          default is 'cn'. Can get overwritten in escidoc-core.properties.
        - Added property escidoc-core.aa.attribute-name.persistent-id that holds the name 
          of the Shibboleth-Attribute containing the persistent id of the user. Has to be unique.
          This is important for creation of the userProxy if logging in via Shibboleth.
          default is 'eduPersonPrincipalName'. Can get overwritten in escidoc-core.properties.
          --> for login via Shibboleth, the Shibboleth-SP has to deliver 2 Attributes: cn and eduPersonPrincipalName
              otherwise login will not work properly!!

    August 2009:
        - because of the unification of primary keys of fedora and our internal database 
          we had to change the keys of the default scopes, 
          aggregation-definitions, report-definitions and aggregation-tables 
          that ship with the escidoc framework. see https://www.escidoc.org/jira/browse/INFR-751
		- ReportDefinitionHandler.retrieveReportDefinitions: switched to SRU, filters are given as CQL query, response is a SRW response now
		- All other filters exist in two versions now: The old version with XML filter parameter and a new SRU like version with CQL query and SRW response.

    July 2009:
		- removed member-refs from resources in XML Schema of Container and Context
		  TODO: change schema version
		- added SRU like filter methods
