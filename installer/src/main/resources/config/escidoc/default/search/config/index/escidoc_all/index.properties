#Directory Implementation for lucene (used for merges + optimize)
#can be:
#
#org.apache.lucene.store.SimpleFSDirectory:
#is a straightforward implementation using java.io.RandomAccessFile. 
#However, it has poor concurrent performance (multiple threads will bottleneck) 
#as it synchronizes when multiple threads read from the same file.
#
#org.apache.lucene.store.NIOFSDirectory:
#uses java.nio's FileChannel's positional io when reading to avoid synchronization when reading from the same file. 
#Unfortunately, due to a Windows-only Sun JRE bug this is a poor choice for Windows, 
#but on all other platforms this is the preferred choice. 
#Applications using Thread.interrupt() or Future.cancel(boolean) should use SimpleFSDirectory instead. 
#See NIOFSDirectory java doc for details. 
#
#org.apache.lucene.store.MMapDirectory:
#uses memory-mapped IO when reading. This is a good choice if you have plenty of virtual memory relative to your index size, 
#eg if you are running on a 64 bit JRE, or you are running on a 32 bit JRE but your index sizes are 
#small enough to fit into the virtual memory space. Java has currently the limitation of not being able to unmap files from user code. 
#The files are unmapped, when GC releases the byte buffers. Due to this bug in Sun's JRE, MMapDirectory's IndexInput.close() 
#is unable to close the underlying OS file handle. Only when GC finally collects the underlying objects, 
#which could be quite some time later, will the file handle be closed. 
#This will consume additional transient disk usage: on Windows, attempts to delete or overwrite the files will result in 
#an exception; on other platforms, which typically have a "delete on last close" semantics, 
#while such operations will succeed, the bytes are still consuming space on disk. 
#For many applications this limitation is not a problem (e.g. if you have plenty of disk space, 
#and you don't rely on overwriting files on Windows) but it's still an important limitation to be aware of. 
#This class supplies a (possibly dangerous) workaround mentioned in the bug report, which may fail on non-Sun JVMs. 
#Applications using Thread.interrupt() or Future.cancel(boolean) should use SimpleFSDirectory instead. 
#See MMapDirectory java doc for details.
#By default Lucene detects the best implementation by itself.
fgsindex.lucene.directory.implementation = org.apache.lucene.store.SimpleFSDirectory

#Sets the maximum chunk size (default is Integer.MAX_VALUE for 64 bit JVMs and 256 MiBytes for 32 bit JVMs) 
#used for memory mapping. Especially on 32 bit platform, the address space can be very fragmented, 
#so large index files cannot be mapped. 
#Using a lower chunk size makes the directory implementation a little bit slower 
#(as the correct chunk must be resolved on each seek) 
#but the chance is higher that mmap does not fail (used by merges of segments).
#fgsindex.maxChunkSize = 200000000

#The MergeFactor controls how many documents are stored within each segment 
#before a new one is started and how many are started before they are collected into a larger one. 
#So a Factor of 10 means, 10 documents before aggregating 
#and 10 aggregated indexes of a certain size before aggregating again. 
#Consequently MergeFactor controls the number of open files.
