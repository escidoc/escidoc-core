#  eSciDoc Infrastructure Properties
# ==================================================
#
#  This file contains the default-properties used by the eSciDoc-Core-Infrastructure.
#  
#  If you want to change some of the properties to values other than the defaults,
#  you can just change them in this file 
#  or you can overwrite them by redefining them in a file with name escidoc-core.custom.properties, 
#  that has to be located in the same directory this file is located.
#  
#  Properties defined in the file escidoc-core.custom.properties 
#  overwrite the values of the properties defined in this file.
#  
#  Redefining them in the file escidoc-core.custom.properties makes it 
#  easier for you to see what properties you changed 
#  and easier to reset the properties to their default-values.
#
